# stark-localization-dissipation
  an external electric field can lead a localization-delocalization transition named stark localization. The eigenstates and eigenvalues can be solved analytically. Stark localization show interesting dynamic behaviors like bloch oscillation and dynamic localization. I want to investigate what will happen if we add a dissiapation term to the system.
  Liouvillan gap can be used to determine the timesacle that an open system arrive the steady state. 
  the first part ,we confirm the Liouvillan gap is independent on the particle number for free fermions.(L_N,L_N1)
