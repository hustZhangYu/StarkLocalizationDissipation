# stark-localization-dissipation
  an external electric field can lead a localization-delocalization transition named stark localization. The eigenstates and eigenvalues can be solved analytically. Stark localization show interesting dynamic behaviors like bloch oscillation and dynamic localization. I want to investigate what will happen if we add a dissiapation term to the system.
